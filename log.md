# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: ngResource, Angular Form Validation, user prompting with Bootstrap help-block

**Thoughts**: retreive data from back-end(RESTful API) via ngResource, disable HTML5 form validation, use ng-class/ng-show to promting user.

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: ngResource $save, CORS

**Thoughts**: send comment with $resource().$save(), support CORS with module(cors), not simple request will have a OPTIONS request as CORS prefilght to get the support server CORS methods, redirect from HTTP to HTTPS when CROS prefilght will cause invalid.
